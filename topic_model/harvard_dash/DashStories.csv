Our mission is the sustainable management of natural resources, and since many final environmental goods and services are not delivered via a market, we have a strong interest in ""the beyond GDP"" debate.  In this context I have been musing about whether there is a paradigm shift underway in Economics, and to that end I recently read Akerlov's Presidential Address to the American Economic Association in 2007 where he analyses the ""five neutralities"" which undermined the Keynsian consensus, which includes Barro's rediscovery of Ricardian Equivalence, the subject of the article I have just accessed from this site.  I have to admit that I can think of only one possible example of this in practice - Japan during the 1990's.  I find Akerlov's argument that the five neutralities all involve the exclusion of norms from utility functions quite persuasive.  Turning to the open access features of your site.  I greatly value such opportunities.  Knowledge should be treated as a public good.

But, unfortunately, many journal articles are paywalled. I find it frustrating and demoralizing to hit a paywall when following a line of research citations. Shouldn't knowledge be free? Making knowledge accessible to as many people as possible maximizes the probability of someone ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" to create new knowledge. 

I want to build a career for myself where I feel like what I do makes the world a better place, and I notice that most of the individual academics which I've came into contact with seem to share a similar motivation. So, there is a rather stark contradiction here: sharing of knowledge makes the world a better place, this is a significant objective for most of the people who publish, but access to their product is so often restricted. 

All this to say: thanks for the open access initiative, I very much appreciate it and I think it is the right thing to do on principle.

Texas was not created for the mexicans who follow the Pope... it was made for us Texan kids. It is a unique place..

That is a large amount of land and people that was fumigated by this group of people's shit that ""fucked up""... 

I do not like the bush's coming from connecticut and playing king of the hill with our people. This Harvard and Yale group of rich kids from Massachussettes think they can embed into another society and run the show.. Obama with Hawaii, Fuckerberg with California (who has supremely fucked up with his little facebook bullshit), Bill Gates with Washington State, and the Bush family in Texas... These people are trained to use their money to control the population around them and they shake hands with all the other rich assholes from their schools to push their agenda upon the country as a whole. These people did not earn the right to govern the people. They have never suffered.. their priorities are not to make people's lives better. 

Our kids in Texas go outside. That is the best part about our state. These housing editions need more trees like Mountain Valley in Joshua and a golf course to run around on at night kissing girls and scraping their knees. California has fucked up with their cookie cutter houses next door to each other and their terrible air so people have to stay indoors. The mexicans run that fucking state now. These mexicans are spanish speaking mayans who burn candles to the Pope across the atlantic. They do not recognize our leader unless he is a gangbanging dancing nigger... These two last presidencies were the worst for Americans.. Bush with his little war for oil control and bombing the twin towers so the thirteen colonies would be weakened so he could shift the seat of American power to the center of the country was a fucking disaster. Kids from texas got boats and houses.. the little uneducated gas kids by the way... not the smart kids who went to school because they enjoyed school and deserve boats and houses. Bush gave all the good shit to the wrong kids who are alcoholic mild delinquents... The Obama-Zuckerberg years gave all the good shit to the media monkeys.

Thank you for your quick and concise review of the book on the life and diary of Perpetua. The clarity of your open journal article provided what I needed to begin to sort through the historicity and religious context of Perpetua was. It also clarified the complexity of the Montanist controversy. I can see from the article that there was a bit of politics going on at the time over the ecstatic elements of the group. It is interesting that Augustine found her life and death worthy of 4 sermons. Also, that Tertullian was connected with the movement, it can be seen that there were adherents in many places, and that there was quite a variety among adherents is also clear. In addition, the fact that Perpetua lived earlier in that window of time when montanism was less well known except for in Phrygia helped me understand the progression. Propinquity has a way of helping sort out the complaints of those much removed in time from the actual events.

The EU center told Us the disease isn't rare we knew it based on research papers and reported my daughter has a 49.7% loss on her porohyria enzyme called CPOX. When I asked   another NIH funded Porphyrias Consortium Dr Bissell who also gets NIH funding why the enzyme test wasn't used in the US he said we have DNA. Well my daughters DNA came back with no pathogenic mutations it was only under 2016 hippa that we were able to find out  she had 10 mutations on 5 porphyria gene  and. 3 mutations with an amino acid change known to reduce the cpox enzyme carried in a large percentage of the Caucasian population and a gain on cpox.

I returned to Australia and had a career with the (then) CSIRO Division  Food Science & Technology in Brisbane (1971-1993). In 1994 moved to the University of New England (UNE) in Armidale NSW and was Professor of Meat Science &Technology in the School of Rural Science and later Head of School (1999-2001). Following the death from cancer  of my wife of 40 years, I retired in 2004. I remained in Armidale  and  in 2009 was  recruited as University Ombudsman. This was a part - time position which I occupied until May 2015. At that time I was diagnosed with colon cancer. This was successfully removed and to date has not returned. I am re-married and, in 2015, my wife and I returned to Queensland to Toowoomba, which is a large regional city (pop. ca. 120,000) on the Great Dividing Range 120 km west of Brisbane. Last year I joined the local U3A and attended courses in Investing and Geology. As a result of this involvement, I recently offered to be Tutor for a new course Food & Nutrition whish will be available in terms 1&2 in 2018. I am currently writing the material for this course, which will start early in February.

Well, here is the answer:  
""The first documented case  (of doping)  is in 1865, when Dutch swimmers used stimulants ""
Even the gifted students at your fine college repeated the 1865 Dutch swimming line which is the 6th time I have seen it---and the 6th time I've seen it sans reference.

6343,10/18/2017 7:41,may_share,US,"It is currently 3:17 AM, and as I am researching various perceptions of the definition of hypo-descent, I amazingly stumbled across Dash! I am an aspiring sociology student attending Tacoma Community College who derives from an unique multi cultural background. I have lived a life full of tremendous variation, adapting to a spectrum of social constructs as a victim of the continuous metamorphic nature of racial formation in America. This article was amazing as I can relate to many variables.
My Father was an African American Army veteran who committed suicide while my mother was 3 months into her pregnancy with me. The odds to prevail and overcome the obstacles implemented to stagnate my census classification had been cursed upon me before I inhaled my first breath. My mother was a 1st generation Korean Immigrant who married a German - American soldier and had two children. Her next husband was a Filipino man whom my mother had another child. Later, my mother would have 2 more children with an African American and Melanesian mixed man, one of those children being myself. After my father's traumatic departure from existence, my mother would have a last child with another African American man. Many perceptions and probably 100 Master's thesis can be written about why my mom had kids by so many different men; however, I'll leave that open for future discussion. 
At the age of 4, I experienced poverty for the first time, as my mother's language limitations ultimately made her vulnerable to a real estate scam that forced us to lose the house my father left behind. 
Shortly after loosing our home, my mother took my little brother and went back to Korea, leaving me as the youngest of 5 boys with no adult supervision. This was during the height of the LA gang migration to other western states and this influence would be the beginning of a saga full of diversity, failure, pain, and achievement. My story is so dramatic and full of trauma that Hollywood would struggle to capture its essence on film. Raised without parents and being conditioned the majority of my life to be a soldier of urban America brought many horrifying experiences. 
I would become a felon as a juvenile at the age of 12. My teenage years were full of gang violence, drugs, and searching for the reason my life was in constant vertigo. 
Through the halls education, I discovered new pathways and the high school I attended tried to provide me with the support system I never had; however, after extraordinary progress, I would find myself becoming a father AND in prison by the age of 18. 
9 years in prison would be my fate and I would lose every dream I ever had. My reality was already a battle field, and to lose my freedom, son, hopes, dreams, and a piece of whatever dignity I had left was a critical point in my life. 
In prison, I decided to steer my life and become someone who could be a role model to my children, Not only a role model for my own, but for the youth who walk in the shoes I once set odysseys in. I continued my education, completed all required programs, and after nearly a decade I would once again set my feet onto the soil of the free man. 
I would wake up everyday optimistic about finding work and assimilating back into society as a tax paying contributor to society. This was not the case as it took the 328th (never forget) job application to receive my first return call... and I did not even land the gig.
I would struggle in a new world with a whole new culture and social construct that was heavily influenced by the introduction of the Internet and the rapid growth of social media. I served nearly 9 years in prison, and It has taken me another 9 years to proudly stand before society. I have paid my debts to the community and today I am a Mental Health Peer Specialist through the WA State Department of Behavior Health and Recovery and Department of Health. Finding work is always an obstacle as a felon, but I've been blessed with consistent jobs. I've found my way back into the halls of higher learning and currently hold Phi Theta Kapa honors. This shared exposure of my life is only 10% of the story as I am forever engulfed in an eternal journey searching for pathways to ultimately find platforms for others to also conquer recidivism and find wellness in a social construct that was created for failure.

My father had Parkinson disease and since I was 13 years IÕve study things related to it. A huge difficulty that I found was to find reliable sources with up-to-date data and information about the PD (and as a student I wasnÕt able to pay for each information that I would need). As we all know neurology science is a relatively new field and most of the good content is held in reference research centers such as Harvard Medical School. I remember that in the end of 2015 I was looking in the internet for news about this motor problem and found a recent post in the Harvard website telling about a research conducted that would lead to a new form of diagnosing Parkinson in life. My family had a story of a family tremor that made doctors misdiagnose my parent and be unsure about the diagnosis of PD. Unfortunately my dad died in the begging of 2015 and I couldnÕt do much. But by december of the same year I went to a congress over here,  led by the International Institute of Neuroscience Lily and Edmund Safra and met a researcher that studied  Parkinson diagnosis forms. I told him at the end of his presentation about this study and promised to email him with the article. By that period IÕm not sure if the article was ÒclosedÓ (I mean , paid) or if the studied didnÕt end and wasnÕt published yet, so I wasnÕt able to share with him. However, I went to another event this year(2017) and met him again. And now when I got home and looked for the article it was a huge surprise and a great happiness that the article was published and Òfree to seeÓ and finally replied him with the article.

This is Shiomi Kasahara from a Japanese consultancy firm, Mitsubishi Research Institute, Inc.

I am writing to ask your permission for use of diagram of ""Water splittingÐbiosynthetic system with CO2 reduction efficiencies exceeding photosynthesis,"" which appears in your website (https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/27304973/aaf5039%20Manuscript%20rev%20complete.pdf?sequence=1), as a material to be used for our upcoming conference, Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF), hosted by the Government of Japan.

Details of our request are described below.

1. About ICEF:
ICEF is hosted jointly by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan.  It is held annually and its first annual meeting was successfully held in October 2014 in Tokyo, participated by 800 policymakers, business leaders, and researchers from 80 countries worldwide.  The fourth annual meeting is to be held in October 4-5, 2017.

ICEF aims at addressing climate change through innovation, and throughout the two-day conference, discusses intensively on what innovative measures should be developed, how innovation should be promoted, and how cooperation should be enhanced among the stakeholders.

Please find more details in the website: http://www.icef-forum.org/ .

2. How we would like to use your diagram:
Every two years, ICEF selects the ""Top 10 Innovations,"" aiming to raise public awareness of various innovations to counter climate change and to promote such innovations.  The ""Top 10 Innovations"" are chosen from scientific discoveries, technologies, and policies that support innovative business approaches.  The selection criteria are ""GHG emissions reduction potential,"" ""Innovativeness,"" and ""Feasibility.""  A shortlist of 25 candidates are selected by the board, consisting of distinguished experts of relevant technologies.

For your reference, the Top 10 Innovations of the Years 2014 and 2015 can be found in the following websites: http://www.icef-forum.org/top10/top10-icef2014.html ; http://www.icef-forum.org/top10/top10-icef2015.html .

""Water splittingÐbiosynthetic system with CO2 reduction efficiencies exceeding photosynthesis"" is shortlisted for ""Top 10 Innovations"" for this year.  Participants of ICEF 2017 will be invited to select the final Top 10.

We would like to use your diagram in the following manner:
- In panels/presentation materials to be displayed in the meeting venue,
- On a page under ICEF's website accessible only from registered participants,
- On a page under ICEF's website accessible from the general public, in case it is selected as one of the Top 10 Innovations.

We would appreciate it very much if you could give us the permission for free of charge.  We hope that you would consider this as also a promotional opportunity for you to draw attention to your achievements.

Should you require any assistance from us, please kindly let us know.

Thank you very much again for your consideration and cooperation regarding this procedure and we look forward to hearing from you soon.

""Screen"" suggests a new form of communication that moves from rational deliberation to rapid dissemination of shifting messages. This morning I saw a reference to your study, and took a look at it. I think the study illustrates last night's discussion topic extremely well, and provides a timely and important real-world example.

Giving voice to Kenyan, and by extension Africa the permission to use culturally relevant and specific treatment modalities. This story/article is written from a Western cultural lens. The knowledge which is amplified here is ""White/European/Whiteman's knowledge. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But in order for us African scholars to be of use, or relevant to our communities we must decolonize our minds. You can not use the Beck-Depression scale to screen for mental health issues in Kenya is ethically wrong. Why? Because that measure was not normed for that rural population in Kenya. You can use it, but you gotta explain to your readers what steps you took to make sure the results are valid, reliable and generalizable. This article is written as though the people were just numbers to be counted. It makes assumption that people who have low quality of life in Kenya are automatically depressed! how about the communal support systems where if your Jirani lacks salt you will share. This article perpetuates a colonized lens of demeaning African, and Kenyans. There is an emphasis that this is the first of a kind of research to be conducted in Kenya, good for you but I see a list of references. Us here in the US are fighting for our way of knowledge, our cultural practices that forms the fabric of our society to be respected and acknowledged as other way of knowing, which is significant in treating mental illness.
I commend you for working hard to write this article, but it disappoints me when reading it  for it sounds like a none Kenyan, African writing the article. Here we are resisting imperial/colonial knowledge, a knowledge of erasure, erasing African epistemological stand points, we are raising our voices as psychologists, psychologist to be that there is no one population who is the keeper of knowledge.

Occasionally I've dug to find something similar through Google.

  Today I felt inspired to write a brief proposal to my employer for a rather prosiac but potentially impactful thing and to my great surprise and joy I encountered the study I had heard of in a lecture rather easily at the top of the Google search.

 The proposal - and here I can't begrudge a laugh from you learned scholars - was to supply the cleaning staff with breathable shirts while simultaneously explaining the fact that they are burning calories on the job, similar to the hotel maid study. The breathable shirts is a necessary psychological bridge because of the social construction of the smelly janitor who is forced to chose between doing a good job in a shirt that keeps all the heat in (and often shows outward signs of sweating) or being an allegedly lazy janitor. It's quite the tightrope in fact and most people haven't the faintest idea of just how much is involved in being an exceptional cleaner in a hospital until they experience it for a prolonged period of time.

As a scientist, I am concerned about the growing ""War on Science"" as Shawn Otto puts it in his book of that title, and the growing failures to make conclusions and develop policy not based facts and sound science. I'm especially concerned about these trends:

--Failures of the public education systems to provide basic information in the curriculum on
1.The Earth's planetary history, climate history, AND the climate's role in the discovery of agriculture and the development of civilization
2. How science works
3. How science has been central to the development of industrial civilization
4. The role of fossil fuels in powering that development, and the adverse consequences of the combustion of those fuels on the very future of industrial civilization as currently structured.
-- The trend in journalism to nearly always search for two sides of a story and too often provide relatively equal weight to both sides, even when one fact-based, scientifically supported but the other is neither of these or is based on fake facts or otherwise is simply wrong
-- The growth of many and varied sources of ""news"" on the web and on cable news channels, not all of which adhere to strict rules to prove the veracity of facts and other information provided in a story
And the adverse consequences of these trends for the future of industrial civilization and indeed all of humanity, in the extreme but fairly realistic science-based scenarios.
I have published a few pieces about these concerns at:

The only change is that the situation is much WORSE because the truth of the article applies to major diseases, not just minor ailments  To be brief, in 2008, I was diagnosed with severe coronary heart disease (disease that causes heart attacks and strokes) with a blockage of unknown size and location near my heart.  I was scheduled for an angiogram and told to buy nitroglycerin in case the worst happened.  I was probably faced with 2 choices:  some kind of open heart surgery or death.  Fortunately I lived in the age of the Internet and was able to search for alternatives and I discovered several products that claimed they could remove heart plaque without an operation.  After doing over a month of research and being subjected to ""scare tactics"" by ""established medicine"", I decided to try one.  The only side effect was diarrhea.  The remedy worked and I got rid of most of the plaque within 24 hours.  2 weeks later was my angiogram and the surgeons could not find anything to operate on.  I had beaten the ""incurable disease""  coronary heart disease. probably the worst killer in the world (even more than cancer) without an operation.  All along there was a cure for coronary heart disease that the FDA and Health Canada refuse to recognize.  I did some research as to why this cure gets classified as ""alternative medicine""  and it was easy to discover that powerful ""interests""  are using the clinical trial system to block legitimate cures from reaching the public.  This system has been set up to prevent quack and fake ""medicines"" from reaching the public (eg. thalidomide).  When it does that, it is doing its job.  What the public doesn't know is that it can also prevent genuine cures from coming to the market.  Such was the case of my cure which is called a ""chelation remedy"".  Why?  Too many people are making too much money from suffering and death.  When a person has open heart surgery, they take on average 12 drugs day, sometimes rising as high as 30.  In the United States alone, Americans spend $75 billion on heart medicine.  If the chelation remedy was recognized as a cure pharmaceutical companies would lose $75 billion in profits on the spot.  Other enemies would be heart surgeons, the funeral business, companies that make low cholesterol foods, and any other groups that make money from open heart surgery.  I have also found an effective non-medical way to treat gall stones (mint) and I have heard from others that Shiatsu Massage can cure hay fever and other allergies.  The entire health care industry including the clinical trial system needs to be investigated and thoroughly reformed.

I haven't got much money and the cost of access to much key knowledge is far beyond my means e.g., Springer publications can cost hundreds of dollars and single articles $35. 

My political view on this is that documentation of work paid for by tax dollars should be freely available but access to much of it is restricted in the name of profit and that is unlikely to change so freely available, well-managed resources for credible, peer reviewed material are valuable to people like me. 

To the extent that those of us without formal institutional access who want to pursue research can move beyond maybe-right/maybe-wrong usually anonymous Wikipedia-type resources, we will be more likely to accomplish something of value. 

This is especially relevant now that an entire generation of baby boomer scientists and academics are retiring and will therefore generally have reduced access to important, peer reviewed resources.

Any initiative that provides parity access to knowledge for that generation of scientists, the ones that will follow, and smart laypersons who want to pursue research but don't have parity access to knowledge, will almost certainly enhance society's ability to create knowledge and use it for, one hopes, good.

As a student that strives to have the best resources possible, I feel at ease to know that I am getting information that is reliable and detailed for my reports in the classroom and at work without costing me any money. 

As a student that has always wished to have knowledge disseminate from individuals that are authorities in their field, this service is invaluable to me. Without it, I do not believe that I would have learned as much as I would have. I personally believe that Harvard having a database open to the public helps them to stay competitive against other research institutions increases exposure for Harvard and their professors and students who publish them.

Recently, one of our professors circulated a video stating that a Harvard University study had come out claiming that ""In 2018, Harvard University predicts only 33% of all jobs will require a 4-year degree or more, while the overwhelming majority will be middle-skilled jobs requiring technical skills and training at the credential or Associates Degree level.""  This leads the author to claim that there's this 1:2:7 ratio where every 1 job created that requires an advanced degree beyond a Bachelor's will result in 2 jobs that require a four-year degree, but 7 jobs that require a technical certificate.  Here's the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEXBIO1-aEY&feature=youtu.be   The original video was created by Citrus College (a community college in Azusa, California) Department of Technical Education. 

I've been attempting to obtain the original study and just found it here, or at least this study is cited as the source.  I'm very concerned because the email discussion from our faculty has been that we shouldn't necessarily encourage or ""push"" our predominantly first-generation, Hispanic-serving, high percentage of Pell grant recipient students into a four-year or beyond degree because the video argues that ""25% of top associate degree holders earn more than $68,000 per year but the bottom 25% of  bachelor degree holders earn less than $34,000"" so we shouldn't necessarily believe that more education leads to higher wages.  Of course, they don't cite median or average earnings associating level of education and wages other than at the beginning in a fashion that leads you to believe that they are not entirely true. There is no empirical sources or evidence presented in the video which our faculty didn't take into consideration and they are advocating showing it to all our students.  My fear is, of course, that this would lead our students to think that a bachelor's degree is not worth the investment despite plenty of evidence that shows that it is.  Ironically, all of the faculty responding have at least a Master's degree which affords them a position as a faculty member and the privilege to participate in the dialogue.  And those who have children wouldn't necessarily advocate for their own children to simply attain a technical certificate in lieu of a four-year or professional degree.

My name is Peggy Sue, and I am a third year law student completing my Juris Doctor degree at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, Canada. I will be citing an article I found on your database titled ""Performance Enhancing Drugs: History, Medical Effects & Policy"", in my term research paper for a course about sports law. This article describes the historic use of performance enhancing drugs in sport, dating back to the Olympics held in ancient Greece. The author explains the evolution of anti-doping rules into modern international sports law. Lee suggests that today, doping rules are simply defined as anything that governing bodies, or authorities, choose. This has interesting ethical implications which I will reflect upon in my writing.

My paper's thesis explores the potential problem anti-doping rules could pose for Skateboarding during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.  A recent California lawsuit has brought to light controversy over the International Skateboard Federation's relaxed approach to mandatory drug testing. How will Skateboarders from California, who can legally buy and use Marijuanna, perform in the Tokyo Olympics under WADA drug tests? Marijuanna is considered an illegal substance by local authorities in Japan, which could mean harsh penalties for any athlete caught using this substance.

I am trying to track down: (1) the original version of Mary's 1860s diary so that I can compare it to the version published by C.

(I'm enjoying C. Vann Woodward's version of it, but I'm guessing he didn't want to go into greater detail and explanation in his footnotes as the book is already over 800 pages long.

I am interest in how the media even reportedly scientific media such as New Scientist is reporting very biased coverage of Trump and the threat of populism.  I am speaking as a Christian Anarchist blocked from an anarchist fb group for standing by my pacifist convictions and not being ready to beat the 'fascists' that voted Trump into office up.  My crime to say I will stand in front of their 'supposed rape victims' and take their rape but I will NOT beat people up for having different beliefs to mine, I will not presume my beliefs are superior and that this makes me a superior person in general to anybody else.  I was blocked because apparently it is in my best interest that pacifists beat people to death to prevent my rape.  Reading the article on populism, articulated my thoughts very well and also helped me understand why the left has become permeated in self righteousness, arrogance and contempt for the ideals it is supposedly defending.  Why people are using Pussy grabber for Trump but not the supporter of the 'Heroic Rapist Julian Assange' for Chomsky or Zizek to meant just a few.  Why my rape didn't matter literally months ago but now it is justifiable reason for genocide.  Also why I can tell no difference between 'Kill the muslims to prevent my rape' to 'Kill the Trump supporters to prevent my rape'.  The article brought the reason why both are the same to light, and helped me understand the thought processes of a culture that exports its madness around the world.  What worries me most is that Anarchy and the left cannot see past its metropolitan anti populism superiority complex while anarchists who are supposedly anti hierarchal yet they are putting themselves and academia on a pedestal for no good reason and the left looks down on those who created the movement.  Lastly the puzzling question of why I was not a fascist when I voted yes to leaving UK & EU governance for an Independent Scottish Government but fascist, racist, xenophobe for voting to leave the EU.  Why exactly has wanting power to be more localised and within the reach of the community suddenly become fascist to anarchists?  Why does David Graeber think I am fascist for expecting him to live by Martin Luther King's statement that you don't pick and choose pacifism or civil disobedience, way of live occupy demonstrators should be willing to go to jail when it DOES NOT suit them - that is the whole point of civil disobedience.  I have the right to pick up my cross as Tolstoy says and march to jail and death like Gandhi, what I do not have the right to do is prevent others from this because government picked an inconvenient time to imprison me.  Pretty sure the times Gandhi and MLK were imprisoned were also inconvenient, but also vital.  Civil disobedience means imprisonment and it is the action of change the action of saying violence and death do not cower me it is the ultimate political and ethical act and yet it is being called fascist if it happens to coincide with a manicure appointment.   Yes the article was very informative and well written I would recommend as many people as possible read it because we are inundated by group think, where we set our group on a pedestal and demonise any other group, and this is everywhere, all politics right now is irrational, arrogant and self defeating.","""Here, the People Rule"": A Constitutional Populist Manifesto",1/12967873,NONE,None,595

At 10.10.10, a 501(c)3 organization, we have developed a program that brings together 10 Prospective CEOs (who could come from anywhere in the world) and 10 wicked problems over 10 days. Our focus is new venture generation with an emphasis on ROI and Impact. 

Only with ready access to research will we be able to identify wicked problems in health, water, food, energy, learning, infrastructure, waste, and climate change. As part of our program we engage ""validators"" organizations and individuals with a deep understanding of particular wicked problems and wicked problem areas. Access to research helps identify validators appropriate to a wicked problem, progress (in terms of research) on particular wicked problems, trends, developments, discoveries and breakthroughs. 

In 2017, 10.10.10 will host two programs. One, 10.10.10 Health, will occur June 5-15 and will focus on 10 wicked problems in health. We will select those wicked problems from those submitted. At present, more than 65 problems are in contention. The second program, in October 2017, will be our first 10.10.10 Cities program. Debuting in Denver, CO, 10.10.10 Cities will focus on wicked problem areas (infrastructure, water, energy, food, waste, climate change, health, learning) that (1) are widely reported in large U.S. cities; (2) present opportunities for innovation that could elicit strong entrepreneur and investor interest.  

Within 10 years, 10.10.10's venture generation programs will be creating 100 new ventures each year, and 10.10.10 Cities will host and mange programs in at least 10 U.S. cities. And for its Prospective CEOs, Validators, Ninjas (experts in particular areas), and partners, 10.10.10's venture generation platform will provide access to a network that includes connections to sources of research and information (like dash.harvard.edu), relevant IP available through tech transfer programs, legislative and policy archives and updates, and more. All of this will be used to encourage Prospective CEOs to create new products & services and start new companies with a focus on addressing the world's wicked problems.

Thanks for releasing this knowledge to the public. The people and I depend on you to release the best information produced by the smartest people. (And not the idiots who run the media). Your story has been bastardized by many media sources (CNN, Vox, and even snapchat) and once the media rewrites your experiment data, all of the evidence and interesting discoveries are left out of the story. If you were to stop publishing your brilliant work, the people of the public nation would suffer even MORE from a pandemic of stupidity at the fault of major media groups. For the sake of educating our massive population of oblivious individuals, please keep up the good work. Thank you for making a difference.

My attempts at stride improvement lie in trying to tap into my early man psyche and remember how my body was created through evolution to run.  The article was an amazing addition to my thought process and really a nice way to think about how speed changes can change my body feel and the relative energies expended.  I often run with my dog, a sight hound.  Sighthounds were one of early human's most effective tools in the killing of game.  My dog's ability to sight, kill, and retrieve small game far outstrips my own, in fact it's his reason for living.  Yet his struggles to change speeds from his optimal trot compared to me are evident.  He pants and struggles at a fast trot more quickly than I do.  This phenomenon helps me see why early humans were able to use running itself to kill animals thanks to the advantages of bipedalism.  The one thing that my dog does when he is running best is that he is not thinking about how to do it well, he just lets it happen.  For me, not thinking about my running while running is my greatest challenge.

Following each we had lengthy discussions about the implications of the project-based learning model that characterizes High Tech High in San Diego. We discussed the likelihood of long-term benefits of project-based learning vs. a more traditional high school education - partly based on the students in a Colorado school who resisted the shift to project-based learning because they were more interested in high scores on their high-stakes tests for college entry. Thanks to one student in my class, who accessed this dissertation as a follow up to our closing discussion to the HTH documentary, we are all able to connect more of the dots about models of engagement for high schools. As a result we realize that a key part of the ""big picture"" is the animated commitment of parents to their children regardless of what school their child enters for high school. Parental support is critical. Without it, places like HTH might be less effective than they are. Add to that the choice of the adolescent and it seems that educators and parents may be closing in on three robust variables - project-based learning, parental involvement, and choice of the adolescent (even if not accepted into a project-based charter school).

I am therefore interested in this article, as it pertains to measuring academic language;  however, I am developing *solutions*.  I am looking at practices, which help the ELL work on science discourse in ways that are not cognitively burdensome.  These practices need to give immediate agency to the learner, since there is too much catching up to do, to attain the vocabulary levels of native speakers by traditional means in one school year. Working with my students in an international school, I have come to feel that reading comprehension needs to be tied to ELLs writing in the genre, which in turn needs to be motivated by engaging in hands-on science activities and discussion about these. Referencing work on cognitive apprenticeship (Collins et al) I feel that reading, writing, discussing and hands-on activities are interactive parts that, when properly sequenced and managed by the specialist, will help ELLs take control of their learning - content as well as language.  I have already completed a masters dissertation in this area, and am looking to continue my investigations of the dynamics of these languaging interactions.

I am a licensed tantric Buddhist spiritual doctor.  Since 1985.
I have received comprehensive cycles of tantric transmission in both the Tibetan Nyingma and Tibetan Kagyu lineages.
In my own ( completely non-academic ) way I am a tantric Buddhist scholar, psychologist, and wizard.  I meet a true professional standard for my work and I always search out the every best teaching materials for western students.
Since like almost all western Buddhists I speak no Asian languages such as Sanskrit, Tibetan, or Chinese, I am utterly dependent on translations.
Medical tantra is of highest and central importance to my study and practice.
I began doing kundalini yoga and tai chi, very clumsily, in 1980.
Over the years I have received many teachings on ancient healing traditions.
In a very real sense I am an ethnomedicine specialist as well as wizard-psychologist.
I have for example the very rare Tibetan Yuthok medical tantra transmission-authorization and practical teaching.
Also very substantial teachings in 3HO kundalini yoga and Taoist chi kung.
This piece of scholarship ""Secrets of the Vajra Body"" is a true breakthru and most useful.

3879,8/21/2015 21:58,may_share,US,"In 1995, I was told I was more resilient than most people and asked how I'd done it (by a psychiatrist). There is more to the story than that. Before he said that, he told me that people with my history tended to live in boxes under bridges, not have successful careers, be good Mom's and put themselves through college and graduate with honors as I had. At first, I thought he was the one who should know the answers. He was, after all, a psychiatrist. Since then I learned that psychiatrists study things that go wrong, not what makes things go right.  

I soon realized that if I was more resilient than others with my history and I could figure out why, I could help a lot of people. That is where my journey to discover the root cause of resilience began. I was busy, raising two children on my own (I was at the psychiatrist because my marriage was ending.) I read everything I could find. I observed a lot, with particular attention to those who seemed to do well in spite of the odds. That gave me hints and clues that I began incorporating in my own life. My life got even better. Eventually, all the pieces began to come together but my successful career was in business, not psychology. 
I began teaching others what I learned. Results included students who overcame long-term depression,  disabling PTSD and even averting an imminent suicide. My students were experiencing more happiness, resilience, and better relationships. It got to the point where I no longer wanted to do anything else (career-wise) because helping people when I knew how was so rewarding. I left my executive position and began doing this full time and writing so I could share my techniques with others.
I like to link my work to science that supports what I've learned and Open Access helps me do this. Including science opens doors for me to help more people--people who wouldn't listen or be interested if it did not have scientific support. 

Bottom line, Open Access helps me help others. I have spent a great deal of the past few years writing because I want to be sure what I've learned survives me so I have not spent a lot of time growing my business. As a result, I don't have the financial resources to buy all the related research. I don't limit my research to psychology. There are many other areas that are related, such as psychoneuroimmunology, quantum physics, organizational behavior, medical science, and many more. 

I have also noticed that many solutions to pressing problems are in the literature already but because they aren't pharma, they are not being brought forward. Problems like the cycle of violence, disparate impact, chronic diseases (including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and depression) all have low-hanging fruit in the literature that could solve many of the problems, thus freeing resources for the more difficult to solve situations. I'm doing my best to highlight these as best I can. 

For example, so-called corporate wellness programs are treating symptoms, not actually using Primary Prevention--which they just as easily could be doing with a much greater positive impact. 

It's one thing to not know how to solve a problem. It's an entirely different matter to know how but not use it. The second, IMO, is an ethical and moral issue. I often think our time period will be judged harshly in the future for having knowledge that would help so many who need help and not applying it broadly. Open access will help change this to something the future will appreciate.

All too often those issues are decided on the basis of superficial analysis, which special interest groups are involved early, and which of those special interests happens to have the best sound bite.  Even when decisions are motivated by altruism, they are frequently misguided.

I foresee a challenging future for my children; recent generations have had the good fortune to enjoy certain unusual economic advantages that appear to be rapidly disappearing.  One of the rapidly vanishing advantages is sources of energy that offer a good energy return on the energy invested to obtain it.  Not only is energy development more costly and less efficient now, energy development and use is in increasing conflict with environmental protection and resource conservation.  

About 20 years ago I began to feel that we no longer had the luxury to make bad choices:  The costs and opportunity costs with those choices increasingly limit future options.  My hope is that computers and the internet allow people to become more informed; that the overall quality of the decisions made on difficult issues improves dramatically.  

I genuinely appreciate your providing access to information that I might not otherwise be able to afford.  I have spent a significant part of my career working for the government:  I routinely find articles that I very much want to read, but simply don't have the extra money to purchase.  These are quite frequently not in my direct areas of practice; instead they tend to be related to issues that I have decided are important for other reasons.

It is readily apparent that Harvard makes substantial effort to make important resources available to people who might otherwise not have access:  That commitment reflects very highly on you.  You have at least one guy out here that genuinely appreciates both your recognition of the potential value that providing free access to research provides as well as your generosity in expending a substantial amount of your resources implementing a very effective program to make it happen.  

Now, if we can just get all the knuckle-headed politicians to read and think . . . .

I am 16 years old and I am student aspiring to study at Harvard. After being rejected because i didn't have my SAT, I have made it an initiative to study my undergraduate from there. I am a contestant in the East African Essay Competition 2015 and basically that's how I stumbled upon this article and to be honest, it was highly useful. Well, I am very passionate about sciences( and do really good at them) but I have a passion for arts like History and Literature. I am very happy to be abl to share my story because it is kind of a sad one. After getting admitted in 3 high schools; oxford high school, darrow high school and layton christian academy, I was too unfortunate to find the fees there to high for me to achieve and that was after receiving my Harvard rejection. At oxford they reduced the fees to US $15500, at Darrow all the financial aid packages had been depleted and the fees still were (US $55000)and at Layton they reduced it to US $16800. I am not sure if by ""share your story"" you meant me pouring out my entire heart on the blank of a screen but I am really happy I am doing it because I am shy about it and since it happened recently in May, I am trying to recover from it. On the other hand, I haven;t lost hope because at first I thought that the only way of getting into Harvard was through joining an American high schoola dn completing my high school from there but I am not an open-minded person and I know that if God wants me to first go to high school there then it shall be done( i don't how or in which way but It shall be done) and if I am supposed to stay here in Rwanda and finish my A'levels then I will but one thing is for sure, I am going to study my undergraduate at Harvard the only worry is when. Thank you and I hope you will publish such even more often. What I wanted to ask form you is whether you can tune me in on techniques or ways to gain a Harvard admission. I got an SAT score of 1740( 510 Cr, 630 Maths, 600 Writing, 9 essay). I was happy for this score because I only had a month to study and I did my best.

Twentieth-Century America while conducting research on my grandparents, Roy and Frances Hulm. My father, Jerome (Jerry) Hulm is the tenth of their 15 children. Your work has, there is no other way to say this, blown my mind and has created an unmatched chatter in my family, and will continue to do so for the rest of our lives. My mother Virgina (Jean) Hulm wrote a family history on the occasion of Roy and Frances' 50th wedding anniversary in June of 1969, and some of these stories are documented the family history. But no one, then, had any idea of how significant their life story is to our regional and national history(as expressed in your dissertation). I have yet to fully comprehend, intellectually and emotionally, how significant your research is to my understanding of myself, my family, and our place in these United States. As an academic, I know how strangely insulated the research world can be, so I express my thanks to you and to Harvard for making these stories available. If you have interest, I'll gladly share my mother's sentimental account of the Hulm family and other documents of interest. My grandfather wrote numerous letters to the editor of various papers and letters to politicians throughout his life. A cherished artifact is a photo of him shaking hands with John F. Kennedy. You have my deepest thanks, and I cannot wait to begin hearing from other family members as they read your work, especially my father who turns 80 this year, and who, I believe, has little knowledge of the legal processes his parents went through.

I have noted that both of them had sisters who were married by Reverend L Daniel in 1858 and James's sister was Nontibane who married Sipanuka from Tafamasi and Thomas's sister was Noziqoko who married Filepi. The early marriages did not consider the family names and particular of women. In the first marriage certificate of Thomas Hawes the family name of the first wife, Unjase is not mentioned and this make it difficult to trace the lineage using the written history. The interesting thing was that the wives will be known by their father's names. Unjase's father was uMnadi from the Cele stock. I have not yet been able to trace Mnandis family. If Mnandi was Christianised, it would be very difficult to trace the family not unless uNjase had an exempted certificate. In this case no records of exempted certificate of Thomas could be traced.

The lesson that one has learnt is that written records can be misleading and should be supported by a very strong oral history which is very difficult to find. The experience has taught me that one should to be able to separate anecdotes which common in black history from historical facts.

Another important tool to research the history of black people is family salutations (Izithakazelo). Izithakazelo are always written in codes which mostly are in a language that is not understood by most people.

The Gobas are known as Jangaza (se) Mbambo and no one can explain the combination of the two words but down the lines it also say nina abamndayi ngambili. Mbambo family name is also found at Mthethwa clan. My conclusion with this mndayi is that it means a nation. I am now inclined to say the Gobas are constituted by the two clans namely the Gobas and the Mthethwas. It is for this reason that tracing the origin of Loel Hawes is difficult. The early families had polygamies and only the matrimonial trace could assist to improve the family tree. The conclusion that I have arrived at is that Mbambela was part of Mbiyane family whose son was Klas/Klaas Goba. The location of houses and the family ties in doing things and photos give me a sense of comfort. Andile also bears the features of Cetshwayo Goba.


In conclusion such article are very useful as they help young historians like me to have a better way of looking at history but not to accepts citations as absolute facts.",Practices of Naming and the Possibilities of Home on American Zulu Mission Stations in Colonial Natal,1/10733119,Other Research Unit,None,462

Furthermore  PM 2.5 and smaller particles that cause inflammation in blood vesels affect all blood vessels so all the organs of the body and their products should  be affected.  In addition, since senior citizens have been around for the longest period of time, they have been exposed to chronic pollution for their lifetime. They are the most likely population to suffer the effects of chronic low level (as well as high level ) pollution.

I have been teaching ESL for over twenty years  both here in Canada and overseas in the Middle East and all the while I have had a singular goal in mind - to develop a better explanation of how English grammar works - a new paradigm - but one that is easily adapted to by those currently teaching under the 'Simple Present Tense' paradigm. 
Learning that Irregular verbs have a half-life inversely proportional to the frequency of usage fits very nicely with my ideas regarding the 'past participle.' The name may have historical significance, but the regular verb 'ed' suffix has a greater role to play than simply to refer to the past. I hope to incorporate this information in a future presentation on the interpretation/understanding of the present & past participles within the new paradigm - outlined in my paper ""An Alternate View of English Grammar"" published in the proceedings of the TESOL Arabia 17th Annual International Conference held in Dubai, UAE in 2011.

The article states:
""Observations and some theory thus suggest that deglaciation increases volcanism.""

The article does not look at typical distribution of glaciation and typical volcanism on the planet.

Perhaps the statement should be made causal rather than as an effect off.
""Increased volcanism causes deglaciation, decreased volcanism increases glaciation.""

It is perhaps the ""cause of"" not an ""effect of"".

Volcanism's heat is 3/4 underwater.  Volcanism is three mid ocean ridges in southern hemisphere and southern circumferencial around Antarctica.  Variation in this southern heat source drives heat transfer south to north and hence glaciation.  The south does not get glaciation it is northern.  Mid ocean ridge and flood basalt is majority underwater.

Volcanism is variable. Variation is capable of climate changes as recorded based on analysis by order of magnitude.

3340,12/14/2014 8:58,may_share,US,"Long story short, when i was 11 years old I made my life goal to time travel. From that age on I went to the city library about once a week to rent books about Einstein, Newton, Galileo, physics, cosmology, geology, history etc. Basically anything about revolutionary science (and their theories) which when introduced changed the entire world's understanding about reality; what is true? What is accurate? What is possible? I was preparing myself, while in my youth, to become an astrophysicist such that I could understand the entire nature of reality as the universe and thus influence/guide/explore this phenomena called ""time"". About 9 years later, while taking my final for a ""mathematics of theoretical physics"" class (at the University of California at Santa Barbara) my mind burped out an immediate epiphany about what time, the universe and reality actually were...observation/perception/attention. That is to say, I came to the realization that the universe wasn't out there on the piece of paper I was solving Hilbert spaces with, it was in my brain's innate ability to recreate a sort of mirror image reflection of the ongoing conditions of the presently observable environment (in this case the desk, the physics final, my pencil along with the hand and arm attached to it). I was so intrigued by this new point of view about the universe that the following semester I changed my major from physics to psychology/neuroscience. The reasoning behind this was that although my physics education would teach me the appropriate mathematical equations for calculating various systems in the universe (and their changing states) it would never inform me about the nature of consciousness, memory or attention. In addition, a contributing factor for changing my field of study worth mentioning is my tenacious curiosity about the science of psychedelic interrupt envelopes and how they affect the modalities responsible for multisensory binding and neuroplasticity. From personal experience (experiments), and the observations resulting thereof, I found myself fervently searching and educating myself about every knowable fact and concept about how ""mind-manifesting"" substances could create temporal perceptions as varied as seeing time freeze to watching the future happen in one's mind's eye only to watch the exact scenario unfold before one's physical eyes moments, hours, days or years later. So much for long story short, but to sum things up I spend most of my free time after work or on the weekends continuing my education in understanding time in the brain. I may have graduated college a few years ago but I never slowed down the pace of my education or accumulation of understanding. In fact, I think I may be learning more now on my own reading scholarly PDF files than I did at any point in my college career (except maybe during finals week or the day before a test...haha i'm sure i'm not the only one). Finally, the whole reason for me attempting to make my long story short was so that I could take advantage of the opportunity to offer my greatest sentiment of graditude and thanks for the existence of Open Access. It is a truly wondrous resource for people like myself who can't afford to continue our education (i.e. go to graduate school) but, just as influential as the financial burdens, also cant afford to cease our education because of the cost of ignorance on our conscience. I set a goal 14 years ago to travel through time, not to change the past or as a way to tour historical events, but instead out of an extension of my own awareness attempting to grasp at a comprehension of the reality of time and my place in it as a self-aware, sentient being.

	Some people are just more deserving than others.

Information from this article was selectively picked and disseminated by the poster to express a number of views that were a direct contradiction to the actual conclusions of the article itself. 

Another poster read this article in its entirety and found that the poster was selectively choosing data that fit their argument, while ignoring the rest of the data and its conclusions. The second poster confronted the first poster with the findings and actual information, and the first poster deleted his arguments from Reddit in response. 

As a function of Reddit, users are up or down-voted based upon the written responses they make in a given forum thread. The defunct poster was successful in convincing more than 400 users to up-vote racist content and false data, before the second poster was able to read the Harvard article and disprove his theory. Due to the popularity of Reddit, it is conceivable that the defunct poster would have become even more popular and spread disinformation across the internet, and people would not even have thought to check on the veracity of the article before accepting it as truthful. 

As of this email, the second poster has more than 3,500 up-votes with their analysis of the defunct-poster, complete with citations depicting the study's actual conclusions. 

None of this would have been possible had Harvard not allowed open access to the article in question. I thank the DASH program for allowing such access to the public, and encourage them to do so with as many academic articles as possible in the future.

I slowly and painfully came to the supposition that, if the Bible was inspired by Omniscience, then one ought to expect a profundity of wisdom and knowledge commensurate with such a source.  The experience of a Native American friend provides a metaphor that indicates the nature of Scripture.  He was fishing on a mountain stream in Virginia and decided to cross the stream to the other side.  He said he looked down and figured the water was 2-3 feet deep as he could see the grains of sand rolling along the bottom. He stepped off into water 18-20 feet deep and almost drowned.  As a former Atheist and one more oriented to intellectual aspects of life, it made quite an impact on me to see that the Book that I had once considered as junk was deeper than I could possibly conceive.  Like my cousin, when he was in the navy, who was invited by the captain of his ship along with the other sailors to go swimming in ""the deepest swimming hole in the world,"" I found that I was dealing with a book of ideas and other elements (literary masterpieces, scientific realities, and an optimism utterly unbelievable (a future for the earth of anywhere from 20,000-900,000 years plus man's settling of the planets of far away solar systems).  I have found that the reality of the intellectual element, that is, the way the ideas are presented to influence behavior, is of such a nature as to make a person balanced, flexible, creative, constant, and magnetic.

They thought they saw an answer in a promotion developed in the USA's mid-west in the late 1940s). That promotion -'Shop Locally'- had proved reasonably successful; County after County had succeeded in convincing their local Communities to reconsider 'Outshopping'. (I.e. resist the temptation of the seemingly 'brighter lights and 'greener pastures' of distant towns.

But the USA had only one issue to confront; Australia had two and it has been that failure to see the 2nd issue that has led to their Traders (small to medium sized retailers, usually owner operated and shopping strip based), slowly drowning in a rising tide of dead and dying stock. 

'Shop Locally' has been a complete disaster. This paper has been instrumental in having towns accept that 'Shop Locally' is not for them and to see why they will need to reconsider their respective positions. 

As matters stand, Traders are now considering an alternate solution to their problems; that solution has the distinct advantage of being the same as is needed to resolve three (3) of the most difficult and long-lived issues facing business (and any Advertiser/Marketer) worldwide; the effectiveness of the Advertising budgets; the efficiency of the Marketing spending and the precision of the PR budgets.

My solution to the issues discussed in this article; particularly productivity, absenteeism,  (while adding other issues such as life distractions, and workplace relationships), can be addressed by offering small group educational sessions along with individual sessions on Advance Care Planning for healthcare services.  The employee is able to use this wellness program for themselves and other members of their families.

The province I live in majority is French. Many ditch high school at a premature age in pursuit of other economic gains. In Qubec, 50 years ago, the public College system was implemented to stimulate trades and professions otherwise unattainable to the French mass, seeing the class structure was English oriented.

In 2011-12 when the Occupy movements gripped the world, the Qubec student balked at the prospect of paying the difference on tuition during Liberal austerity measures (especially at a 200-400% increase within a decade for a simple undergrad BAC degree). ''Maple Spring''. 

The leaders that managed the province for the past decade failed in their attempt to appease the fundamental privilege each person has to education in this province and so they were voted out for a different party with outdated ideals.

Now the province is marching steadily to a second election within 18 months since minority government inspired change due to corruption and disenfranchised Canadian sentiment. The motives are secular, hate inspired and bias - seeing the media is intertwined with politics like it was in Italy with former PM Silvio Berlusconi, the separatist moguls here are eroding the base of identity to bargain a third referendum in 34 years.

I fear for Qubec as it may whitewash the progress it has made as a collective.

To be clear, I know nothing of Najarian, but I do know a great deal about Stanislaw Burzynski, and the inaccuracy of the claims around Burzynski casts doubt on the rest of the paper, and indeed on the writer's critical judgment. 

At the time of writing this paper, it was abundantly clear that Burzynski operates in an ethical vacuum. The head of his institutional review board has a vested interest in the treatment, three consecutive FDA inspections have highlighted identical red flag issues with the IRB.

Burzynski himself is not a board-certified oncologist, and appears not to understand basic concepts such as pseudoprogression and ischaemic necrosis. His prognoses are wildly optimistic; this alone seems to account for the number of people who go to his clinic. In reality his survival rate seems to be no better than chance would predict, especially since most patients have already undergone conventional therapy. 

Nearby hospitals routinely have to pick up patients with severe adverse reactions, and often fly them home using charity funds as Burzynski has left them destitute. Yet he surrounds himself with such a cult of personality that even those he has manifestly failed, speak up for him.

He has made millions of dollars from patients on ""clinical trials"" which his own lawyer admits are a sham, and despite registering over 60 trials with the FDA, he has failed to complete and publish a single one. He's been selling an unproven treatment as if it's proven for over 35 years, and has never shown any sign of acknowledging that he carries the burden of proof for demonstrating its efficacy. 

The trials were put on hold in January 2013 due to the death of a patient, following which it became apparent that serious adverse events were not reported for years, records were falsified and destroyed, and Burzynski could not even account for the amount of drug in circulation. 

His problems with the FDA and Texas Medical Board stem from his own incompetent science, from the ethical violations at his clinic, and from his unwillingness to follow the same approval rules that every other manufacturer has to follow.

A recent article in USA Today gives an accurate overview. All these facts were available at the time this paper was written, with the exception of the published FDA letters showing destruction of data, and even those were available under FOIA in around March, which is when I first saw them.

In summary, then: the writer of this paper has ignored massive red flags and has been drawn in to a conspiracist agenda to support a man who can only justly be described as a cancer quack.",The Criminalization of Innovation: FDA Misdirection in the Najarian and Burzynski Cases,1/9453691,,None,445

778,11/6/2013 14:34,may_share,CA,"Access to any one article does not make a big difference to my life. But having access to scholarly research in general has made a tremendous impact on my life.

I was 12, undiagnosed autistic, very intelligent, and a victim of sexual abuse from foster siblings and bullying at school, when my parents finally started homeschooling. They did not know if it would work - if they could teach me effectively, if I would cooperate for learning. All they knew was that they were afraid for my mental health if I stayed in regular schooling.

They started out trying to teach me with essentially the same methods at home as the school had been using. But I couldn't handle that. Being told what to do made me scared, and I coped with this fear by defiance. What should have been educational was turning into daily battles. So my parents backed off.

I may not have been teachable, but I was very good at learning. A typical characteristic of autism is intense interests. In my case, these interests revolved around psychology and genetics. I started with simple Google searches, but soon my interest led me to seek more scholarly sources of information.

So here I was, in my mid-teens, not registered with any university, but searching for articles on PubMed, visiting my local university's health sciences library, reading articles on ring chromosomes, deletions and duplications. And, most importantly, I was happy. I was curious, excited, enthusiastic. I was not afraid.

It was around this time that I discovered high functioning autism, and began to find a framework to understand my own differences. My official diagnosis came at the age of 15, by which time I'd already extensively read both scholarly sources and personal accounts of high functioning autism. I realized I was not rude, lazy or stupid. I simply had a different kind of mind. better at some things and worse at others.

Throughout my homeschooling, I did not produce work, nor cooperate with testing my abilities. But my excited monologues about my latest discoveries made it clear that I was learning. And this impression was confirmed when I finally managed to take the SAT in order to enter university.

And now, I'm an undergraduate psychology student, but in many ways, I feel more at a graduate student level. I still can't make or keep a study plan, but I can easily follow what my teachers are saying. I have learnt how to write papers and take tests to show what I know. I am not working up to my potential, yet, but I'm learning and enjoying life, and gaining experience to help me achieve my dreams.

If I had not had access to scholarly journals, I would certainly know a lot less than I do. I would not have had nearly as much success in university as I've had, and my future would be much more uncertain. Although I was cognitively capable of university-level material at 13 or 14, I would not have been able to prove it, nor could I have coped with any formal education (even university courses, which are really fun). My only access to knowledge, beyond what my parents could tell me, was what I could find on my own.

I'm lucky to have had parents who were students and university employees. But many children don't have this 'in' with university. They may be just as smart as me, and in some cases just as challenged, but without the advantages I've had. For these students, the only way they can learn about their passions and build confidence in their own minds is through open access journals.","A Neural Dissociation Within Language: Evidence that the Mental Dictionary is Part of Declarative Memory, and that Grammatical Rules are Processed by the Procedural System",1/3600798,Psychology,None,601

This article I found and than used as a soruce of material for a presentation in class. We are have to do five write-ups during each semester and this was one of the articles I chose as it deals with memory retention and accuracy between working memory and short term memory.
 Everything we learn is about how we store and recall information and than using it. Events are encoded differently and in different locations especially depending on emotional content and the value we place on it whether we realize it at the time or not. What may be tramatic for one individual may not be for another. Why? I believe it has to do with how we learn to process the information and encode it as children. I have strong feeling that while we learn all through life, the reactions to stimulaus are defined early on and with out learning new ways to process events old pathways will dominate the thought process (for example PTSD, anxiety, ect). Given the harshest one person can hold it togather and another looses it and gives up. This is a cognitive process; the brain can be tought to think and use new pathways and the old pathways will be pruned out over time because they are no longer useful. Adaptation does not just fall under the domain of Darwin but it is a constantly changing process the brain undergoes throught life and this is what I am driven to understand.

The question is if a police officer should be allowed to make a mistake that allows him to break the law of the 4th Amendment of the United States of America, the importance of this case being that the decision essentially repealed the 4th Amendment without bringing it to vote, a clearly un-American custom.

Convenient if you are on the ""correct"" side of the law. You cannot prove the intent of a mistake, this is virtually impossible. At a minimum, a good faith mistake, aka negligence, should create Òan incentive to act with greater care.""

One assumes it was a mistake then. It is easy to assume a mistake when it puts a guilty person to punishment but again I am not yet sure we capture the reason the 4th Amendment ""was"" the 4th Amendment. It would seem to me that it is an amendment against overcriminalization something our book is quick to bring up in the chapter dealing with criminal law.

And I cited from the open access text ""The contention that the exclusionary rule addresses only conduct that is intentional or reckless, not merely negligent, is fundamentally inconsistent with the very premises of tort law that liability for negligence creates an incentive to act with greater care. And such a test narrowed the exclusionary rule to a virtually unprovable conductÑreckless or deliberate misconduct on the part of police, and negligent conduct that is not just 'isolated' or 'attenuated,'...

Edsall does for readers of the NYTimes: integrating nuggets of leading research from various disciplines into compelling edifications about American politics. My present download is from a link in one of his columns. The more that leading work is available to the intelligent public, the better our chances for cultivating bipartisan progressivism in the U.S. Journals do need to protect their cost coverage, but we need as much access to good research as we can get. 

I wish that leading academic journals could have standing relationships with leading public media, such as the NYTimes, such that any journal article linked from that media's own articles would be a readable download for subscribers to that media. It would be so great (e.g., not having so many JSTor inhibitions) that I'd gladly pay more for my monthly subscription to the NYTimes, as part of their agreement to contribute to a Creative Commons of sorts, like is done for photocopying on campus these days. Why not have open access to all journals that become affiliated with a national academic funding mechanism capitalized by all those progressive billionaires who rightly wring their hands about the quality of public culture in this age of Internet simulacra, where all opinions are treated equal, and fewer and fewer persons find time to deliberate or read carefully because the market for distraction is relentless.

We have use several DASH articles. The most recent research material on DASH which benefited us include the scholarly material written about the devastating affects aid has on Africa.

With little efforts, most governments in Africa can manage to employ majority of their citizens on not more than 10 economic sectors including agriculture/livestock, tourism and public services including health, education and jobs that should be available at all government levels from regional, district and municipal services.

Instead, these industries are shut down in most African countries by way of fear-which leaves farmers to hide from attending their fields (no tourism), no production of any kind. Corrupt governments which get support from donor nations conduct intrusive tactics on its citizens which create even more fear. The donations arrive in the name of disaster management and aid for the 'poor' people. The government eventually loses grip on its citizens and falls from power.

New 'militia' style government comes to power and develops new friends-as the old donor was a supporter of the ""old"" government. They get few years of sustained brutality and picking on the opposing forces. This cycle has continued for much of the last 60 years.

This article has given us few vital statements and figures which will help us convince the government to invest in its people and land instead of waiting for donations. ",Do Corrupt Governments Receive Less Foreign Aid?,1/4553011,Economics,None,254

This provides a lantern to look at who we are and the effect we have on each other and the heritage we have in our hands. I see OPF as a Yellow student tour bus, folk get on for a while at different stages of their private journeys and we share experiences and guide each other, but cherish each travelers individual and original intents.

So we have come upon a situation where art on the walls of streets is being shared. Michael Nagel, is walking the streets of Munich documenting wall art. I couldn't help being impressed by the simple expression in one that man cannot be illegal, "" in post #97 http://www.openphotographyforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11436 and I commented on it in post # 98. My ideas on ""The Rights of Man"" are centered on the effects of the French Revolution in bringing together, like a central drain, the humanistic ideas of philosophers in Europe and their antecedents.  I've been challenged, of course for leaving out Kant. So I decided to look further at his logical imperative and insistence with not lying. To me not lying removes a barrier to the oppressive state closing down sources of news without which the rights of Man cannot be defended. So access to scholarly articles provides a way of non academic and less formal institutions spreading the fruits of academic scholarship to communities world wide without specific knowledge of the keys and entrance points to the academic word.

We put together our own study of over 50 corporate wellness program ROI reports and I believe that helped the debate a bit.

Having a group such as Harvard publish their own study lends more credibility to the findings.

Hopefully this will help more CFOs justify investing in their Human Capital and can better justify allocating funds toward creating behavior change based wellness programs.

I have specifically been attempting to assemble theory that explains the strands of human inheritance formation largely from a sociobiological or evolutionary biological perspective predicated on fundamentals of a thermodynamic context within the scope of human physiology. As those with experience in similar quests know quite well, it is a very broad topic that requires immersion in many subdisciplines of academic thought that only the availability of pertinent documents can provide.  

Because of the difficulties associated with pursuing intelligent thought on a part-time and occasional basis along with the challenges of poverty that the pursuit entails, Open Access in particular, affords an opportunity to obtain intelligent academic research that would otherwise be unavailable to me.  I want to thank Harvard University for permitting me to do that.
